# MATLAB Enzyme Analysis Project
## Enzyme Catalyst Data Analysis Algorithm

### Summary
MATLAB Project where MATLAB code analyzes over 1000+ experimental trials of five different enzymes and calculated performance factors and metrics of each enzyme
Utilize the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics model to compare the efficiency performance of each enzyme 
Plotted MATLAB Graphs and used Eadie-Hofstee model in order to linearize data and calculate accuracy and precision of the data
